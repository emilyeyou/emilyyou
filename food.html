                My favorite dishes come primarily come from three regions of the world: 
                Asia (specifically Southeast and East Asia), the Mediterranean, and 
                Australia. Many of my favorite foods take a modernized approach and 
                have ingredients or presentations inspired by traditional dishes that 
                come from the cultures of these three regions.

                <h2>Asian Food (Southeast Asian, East Asian, and Asian Pacific)</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    One of my favorite asian dishes to order from a restaurant is 
                    curry vermicelli noodles, a dish that originates from Singapore. 
                    The curry blend of peppercorns, cumin and turmeric paired with crisp bean 
                    sprouts garnished on top create a unique balance of textures. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A favorite Asian-inspired dish to make at home is poke bowls with salmon sashimi, 
                    avocado, edamame, cucumbers, and pickled ginger on a bed of 
                    rice. I love how the bowl brings out the natural flavors of 
                    fresh ingredients. Another dish I make often, especially in college, is 
                    teriyaki salmon bowls, which is essentially the ingredients of a poke 
                    bowl but cooked and prepared with a soy glaze.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When I am at a Japanese restaurant, I love to order oyakodon which is a 
                    dish with chicken, egg, and onion served over rice. The main flavor of 
                    the dish is dashi, which is a broth made from dried bonito flakes. 
                    I recently learned how to make this dish for myself 
                    after having bought a small bottle of dashi broth for myself!

                    A childhood favorite of mine and a tradition in my family during 
                    the colder months is hotpot. I grew up helping my mom wash vegetables
                    —typically spinach, cabbage and an assortment of mushrooms—and 
                    arranging a sauce bar.

                    I don't eat out often, but when I do, I get Mediterranean Food because 
                    it is my all-time favorite cuisine. A few favorite Mediterannean 
                    dishes of mine are: chicken shawarma bowls, hummus and pita, 
                    eggplant baba ganoush, and chickpea orzo salad.

                    You might be thinking...wait aren't avocado toast and brunch bowls 
                    with smoked salmon American-style breakfast? Actually, the trendy avocado 
                    toast, smoked salmon plate with eggs, and breakfast bowl varieties 
                    are inspired by the simple, yet nutritious Australian-style cafes menus. 
                    Australia's cafe culture is robust, and it seems that America has quickly 
                    adopted this with the establishment of Instagram-worthy cafes in 
                    the nation's largest cities.
