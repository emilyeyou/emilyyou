                Hi, my name is Emily You. I'm currently a junior at the 
                University of Michigan pursuing a dual degree in UX Design and 
                Cognitive Science with a minor in <a class="link" 
                href="https://cfe.umich.edu/">Entrepreneurship</a>. I am 
                interested in exploring the intersectionality between design, 
                technology, and people.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Around campus, I am involved in <a class="link" 
                href="https://alphathetadeltaumich.org/">Alpha Theta Delta</a>, 
                a professional multidiscplinary design fraternity, and 
                <a class="link" href="https://www.mamclub.org/">
                Michigan Advertising and Marketing (MAM)</a>. Through my experiences 
                in both organizations, I have worked to improve my hard and soft 
                skills with client-facing project work. Creating more ethical and 
                accessible digital interfaces for people is what fuels my passion 
                for design. In between classes, you can find me enjoying the outdoors 
                (unfortunately not in the long Michigan winters though). 
                I love to play volleyball with friends in the Arb, catch a 
                sunset, and explore cute coffee shops and brunch food in 
                downtown Ann Arbor.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a foodie and adventurer at heart, I have found community through 
                sharing my love for food and exploration, and it has only grown since
                I moved to college from across the country. This website shows a few 
                of my favorite cuisines—Asian, Mediterranean, and Australian—some of which 
                I have made myself! I also love to travel, whether it be going on a short day 
                trip, weekend getaway, or finding the most Instagrammable spots (yes, I am 
                guilty of this). So, I have shared a few of my favorite places from where 
                I grew up in Northern California grouped by photo-worthy spots, 
                walkable towns, and overnight stays.
