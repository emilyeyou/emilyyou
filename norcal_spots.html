            <br>
            <br>
            <p>
                Having lived in Northern California my whole life, I grew to love traveling 
                to different towns and appreciate the beauty of towns and outdoor scenery
                not too far from home. The pandemic especially allowed me to be surrounded 
                and feel grounded by nature. On this page, you will find some of my 
                recommended photo-worthy spots, walkable places, and desinations 
                to stay overnight.

                <br>
                <p>
                    The Northern California coast is one of the most picturesque 
                    places I have ever been to. When a friend asks for recommendations 
                    on places to visit that are also great for those spontaneous 
                    photoshoots, I always suggest them to check out Big Sur 
                    along Highway 1, Capitola Village, and the Painted Ladies 
                    in San Francisco. For those willing to take a longer drive to catch 
                    amazing views, Big Sur is a must-stop. Capitola village is a family 
                    and dog-friendly town sprinkled with cute galleries and coffee shops. 
                    The Painted Ladies are a row of Victorian-style houses that resemble 
                    the period of the California Gold Rush.

                    If you're wanting to get your steps in for the day, look no further. 
                    Just outside of the San Francisco Bay Area is Henry Cowell State 
                    Park, home to many hiking trails and the Garden of Eden swimming hole 
                    surrounded by redwood trees. If window shopping and grabbing a lunch 
                    is on the agenda, Carmel-by-the-Sea is a quaint town that is great for 
                    relaxing and annual Art of Wine festival in the spring. Monterey is just a 
                    5 mile drive further south, and it has one of the richest marine 
                    ecosystems in the world. For the ocean-lovers, there are many things to do 
                    including visiting Monterey Bay Aquarium, kayaking, and enjoying a 
                    bowl of clam chowder.

                    San Luis Obispo (SLO), Yosemite, and Lake Tahoe are locations worth staying 
                    for a few days, perfect for a long weekend! San Luis Obispo is a 
                    Spanish town with unique architecture, vineyards, and butterfly groves. 
                    My favorite pit stops are Slodoco donut shop, Avila and Butterfly Beach, 
                    and the evening farmer's market. In my experience, the best way 
                    to experience Yosemite National Park is by hikin, ideally in 
                    Fall or Spring. A few places not to miss: Bridalveil Falls, Half Dome, 
                    El Capitan, and Merced River Rafting. A crowd-favorite and popular 
                    spot year-round is Lake Tahoe, which is located between on the 
                    border of California and Nevada. Whether you prefer to go boating 
                    or skiing, Lake Tahoe is a place filled with adventure.
